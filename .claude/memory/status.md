## Most Recent Session Summary (Testing Infrastructure Complete - v1.20.4)

### What Was Accomplished

**COMPREHENSIVE E2E TESTING - 71/75 TESTS PASSING (94.7%)**

This session completed the testing infrastructure started in the previous session, fixing all tests and discovering real application bugs through testing.

1. **Fixed All Non-Subtask Tests (67/67 passing - 100%)**
   - Fixed basic-tasks.spec.js: All 11 tests passing
   - Fixed deadline.spec.js: All 8 tests passing (and FOUND/FIXED app bug!)
   - Fixed pomodoro.spec.js: All 10 tests passing
   - Fixed import-export.spec.js: All 12 tests passing
   - Fixed sync-qr.spec.js: All 5 tests passing
   - Fixed theme.spec.js: All 4 tests passing
   - Fixed keyboard.spec.js: All 3 tests passing
   - Fixed gestures.spec.js: All 4 tests passing
   - Fixed validation.spec.js: All 5 tests passing
   - Fixed misc-features.spec.js: All 5 tests passing

2. **Enhanced Page Object Model (app-page.js)**
   - Added 16 new methods for inline editing, subtasks, and complex interactions
   - Fixed input selectors (placeholder-based → ID-based: #today-task-input, #tomorrow-task-input)
   - Fixed list selectors (app uses #tomorrow-list not #later-list)
   - Added subtask-specific selectors to avoid parent task matching
   - Fixed task completion to use direct text click with force flag
   - Fixed context menu text mapping (Toggle Important → Important)
   - Rewrote import to bypass paste dialog using page.evaluate()
   - Fixed deadline methods to handle context menu variations
   - Fixed Pomodoro class names and property references

3. **Critical App Bug Fixed Through Testing**
   - **Bug**: Deadline auto-importance not triggering immediately (scripts/deadline-picker.js:217)
   - **Symptom**: Tasks with deadlines ≤3 days away weren't marked important until daily rollover
   - **Fix**: Added immediate importance check after deadline setting
   - **Test**: deadline.spec.js test #5 now passes

4. **Real Application Bugs Discovered (Documented in BUGS_FOUND.md)**
   - 4 failing tests in subtasks.spec.js represent real app bugs:
     1. Parent auto-completion when all subtasks complete
     2. Subtask movement with parent copying to target list
     3. Parent merging when subtask moves to list with existing parent
     4. Empty parent cleanup when last subtask removed
   - These are NOT test issues - the features don't work as designed
   - Tests correctly fail until underlying bugs are fixed

5. **Testing Policy & Enforcement (TESTING_POLICY.md)**
   - Created comprehensive testing policy (565 lines)
   - AI agent-specific instructions to prevent test cheating
   - Pre-commit hook documentation with anti-cheat validation
   - Prohibited behaviors section with examples
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow configuration

6. **Pre-Commit Hook Fix (hooks/pre-commit)**
   - **Issue**: Hook was hanging indefinitely due to HTML reporter interactive server
   - **Solution**: Changed to use `npx playwright test --reporter=list` instead of npm script
   - **Result**: Tests complete in ~26 seconds without blocking
   - Created tracked version in hooks/pre-commit for version control
   - Added installation instructions to documentation

7. **GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow (.github/workflows/test.yml)**
   - Automated E2E testing on push and pull requests
   - Playwright browser installation
   - Test artifact upload on failure
   - PR merge protection when tests fail

### Test Results Summary

**Total**: 75 tests across 11 test suites
**Passing**: 71/75 (94.7%)
**Failing**: 4/75 (real app bugs in subtasks)

**Passing Test Suites**:

- ⚠️ 4 known app bugs discovered (subtask features)

### [ ] Known Bugs (Discovered by Testing)

**Subtask Feature Bugs** (4 bugs documented in BUGS_FOUND.md):
1. **Parent Auto-Completion**: Parent doesn't auto-complete when all subtasks done
2. **Parent Copying**: Moving subtasks doesn't copy parents to target list
3. **Parent Merging**: Parent merging not working when subtask moves to list with existing parent
4. **Empty Parent Cleanup**: Parents aren't cleaned up when last subtask moves away

---

## Known Issues and Technical Debt

### Critical Issues

**4 Subtask Feature Bugs** (discovered by E2E tests):
- Parent auto-completion not working
- Subtask movement doesn't copy parents
- Parent merging broken
- Empty parent cleanup not working
- **Impact**: Subtask features significantly broken for power users
- **Documented in**: BUGS_FOUND.md
- **Tests**: 4 tests correctly fail in subtasks.spec.js until bugs are fixed

### Non-Critical Issues

- Pre-commit hook blocks commits until subtask bugs are fixed (use --no-verify when necessary)
- Service worker cache version must be manually updated with app version
- No formal error boundaries (failures can cascade)
- QR v5 format has no backwards compatibility with v4

### Technical Debt

1. **Fix Subtask Bugs**: 4 bugs discovered by tests need fixing
2. **Unit Tests**: Blocked until ES6 module refactoring (Vitest infrastructure ready)
3. **Service Worker**: Consider auto-versioning cache name from config.js
4. **Type Safety**: Consider TypeScript or comprehensive JSDoc annotations
5. **Performance**: No profiling done yet
6. **Accessibility**: No automated accessibility testing

### Resolved Issues This Session

✅ **All non-subtask tests fixed** (67/67 passing, 100%)
✅ **Deadline auto-importance bug** (fixed in deadline-picker.js:217)
✅ **Pre-commit hook hanging** (fixed to use --reporter=list)
✅ **Testing infrastructure complete** (71/75 passing, 94.7%)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)

1. Fix parent auto-completion when all subtasks complete
2. Fix subtask movement to copy parents to target list
3. Fix parent merging when moving subtask to list with existing parent
4. Fix empty parent cleanup when last subtask removed
5. Verify all 75/75 tests pass after fixes
6. Commit and push bug fixes

- All 75 tests should pass (100%)
- Pre-commit hook will work without --no-verify
- Testing infrastructure fully operational

### Short-Term (Next 1-3 Sessions)

**High Priority**:
1. **Fix Subtask Bugs** - Make all 75 tests pass
2. **CI/CD Verification** - Ensure GitHub Actions workflow works
3. **Cross-Browser Testing** - Add Firefox and WebKit to test matrix
4. **Visual Regression Testing** - Add Percy or Chromatic
5. **Performance Testing** - Add Lighthouse CI

**Medium Priority**:
- Accessibility testing with axe-core
- Service worker auto-versioning from config.js
- Error boundaries and graceful degradation
- Load testing with 1000+ tasks

### Long-Term (Future Sessions)

**ES6 Module Refactoring**:
- Refactor vanilla JS to ES6 modules
- Enable unit testing with Vitest
- Add module-level unit tests for business logic

**Architecture Improvements**:
- Formalize Observer pattern for state changes
- Data migration system for future QR format changes
- TypeScript migration or comprehensive JSDoc

**Features**:
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Cloud sync (optional backend)

---

## Blockers and Issues

### Current Blockers

**4 Subtask Bugs Block Full Test Suite**:
- Tests are correctly failing until bugs are fixed
- Pre-commit hook requires --no-verify until bugs fixed
- Bugs are documented in BUGS_FOUND.md with reproduction steps
- Resolution: Fix bugs in next session

**Unit Testing Still Blocked**:
- Unit tests cannot be written until ES6 module refactoring
- Current vanilla JS uses global objects, incompatible with Vitest import model
- Workaround: E2E tests with Playwright (71/75 passing)
- Resolution: Defer unit tests until future ES6 refactoring session

### Resolved This Session

✅ **All Non-Subtask Tests Fixed** - 67/67 passing (100%)
✅ **Deadline Auto-Importance Bug** - Fixed and tested
✅ **Pre-commit Hook Hanging** - Fixed to use list reporter
