# Project Status - v1.21.0-wip (INCOMPLETE REFACTOR - DO NOT MERGE)

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09T23:30:00Z
**Current Version**: v1.21.0-wip (INCOMPLETE - NOT READY FOR RELEASE)
**Branch**: main (⚠️ CAUTION: Contains broken refactor)
**Working Directory**: ⚠️ UNCOMMITTED CHANGES - Contains incomplete v3 refactor
**Test Status**: 60/75 passing (80.0%) - **REGRESSION from 71/75 (94.7%)**

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL WARNING FOR NEXT AGENT 🚨

**DO NOT CONTINUE WITHOUT READING THIS SECTION IN FULL**

This status file documents an **incomplete data structure refactor** that successfully solves the original bugs but introduces regressions in import/export/QR functionality. The refactor is **architecturally sound** but the serialization code needs completion.

### What Happened

Attempted to fix 4 subtask bugs by refactoring the core data structure from:
- **v2 (old)**: Single `tasks[]` array where each task has a `list` property
- **v3 (new)**: Separate `today[]` and `tomorrow[]` arrays (tasks have NO `list` property)

**Why This Approach**: User correctly identified that "lists should contain tasks, not tasks tracking lists" - this is a fundamental data structure principle that eliminates duplicate parent bugs and simplifies the entire architecture.

### Current Status

**✅ What Works (60/75 tests - 80%)**:
- All basic task operations (add, complete, delete, move)
- All deadline functionality
- All Pomodoro functionality
- All theme switching
- All keyboard shortcuts
- All mobile gestures
- All input validation
- All miscellaneous features
- Subtasks ARE being created (fixed!)

**🔴 What's Broken (15/75 tests - 20%)**:
- 6 import/export tests (file-based sync)
- 4 QR code tests (QR-based sync)
- 5 subtask tests (mostly timing/rendering issues)

---

## Critical Insights for Next Agent

### 1. THE REFACTOR IS CORRECT - DON'T REVERT IT

**This is not a failed approach**. The data structure change is elegant and solves the original problems. The bugs are ONLY in serialization (import/export/QR), not in the core architecture.

**Evidence the refactor works**:
- Storage migration (v2→v3) works perfectly
- All TaskManager CRUD operations work perfectly
- Subtasks are being created and managed correctly
- Task movement works correctly
- 60/75 tests passing (all non-serialization tests)

### 2. Parents Can (and Should) Appear in Both Lists

**This is intentional and correct behavior in v3**:
- A parent with children in Today AND Later appears in BOTH `data.today[]` and `data.tomorrow[]`
- This is NOT a bug - it's by design
- The SAME parent object exists in both arrays (same reference, not a copy)
- When rendering Today, show the parent with only its Today children
- When rendering Later, show the same parent with only its Later children

**Example v3 data structure**:
```javascript
{
  today: [
    { id: "parent1", text: "Parent Task", parentId: null },  // Parent in both!
    { id: "child1", text: "Child A", parentId: "parent1" }   // Child in Today
  ],
  tomorrow: [
    { id: "parent1", text: "Parent Task", parentId: null },  // Same parent!
    { id: "child2", text: "Child B", parentId: "parent1" }   // Child in Tomorrow
  ]
}
```

### 3. NO `task.list` Property Exists in v3

**Removed entirely** - this is the whole point of the refactor!

**How to determine which list a task is in**:
```javascript
// Use the helper method in task-manager.js (lines 37-41)
const listName = taskManager.getTaskList(taskId);  // Returns 'today' or 'tomorrow'
```

**For rendering**: Use the list being rendered, not task properties:
```javascript
// In getRenderData(listName):
moveAction: listName === 'today' ? 'push' : 'pull',  // NOT task.list!
```

### 4. Migration is Automatic and Bidirectional

**Forward migration (v2→v3)** works perfectly:
- `storage.js` lines 63-140: Handles v1→v3 and v2→v3 migration
- Automatically adds parents to lists where their children are
- Removes `list` property from all tasks

**Backward compatibility**: NOT supported - once a user upgrades to v3, they can't downgrade without data loss. This is acceptable for a data structure change.

---

## Files Modified (Uncommitted)

### ✅ Complete and Working

**scripts/storage.js** (lines 46-140)
- `getDefaultData()`: Returns `{today: [], tomorrow: []}` instead of `{tasks: []}`
- `migrateData()`: Handles v1→v3 and v2→v3 migration perfectly
- Creates v3 format with parents appearing in lists where children are

**scripts/task-manager.js** (153 methods refactored)
- `getTasksByList()`: Returns `data[listName]` directly (line 37-39)
- `findTaskById()`: Searches both arrays (lines 46-52)
- `addTaskToList()`: Pushes to `data[listName]` array (line 59-61)
- `removeTaskById()`: Removes from both arrays if needed (lines 68-89)
- `moveTaskToList()`: Array splice operations (lines 97-115)
- `getTaskList()`: NEW helper to find which list contains a task (lines 37-41)
- `findTask()`: Returns task with list info (lines 133-139) - **CRITICAL FIX**
- `getChildren()`: Searches across both arrays (lines 719-732)
- `hasChildren()`: Checks both arrays (lines 768-771)
- `getRenderData()`: Shows parents in lists where children are (lines 766-878)
- Subtask movement (lines 411-447): Adds parent to target list, removes from source if empty

**scripts/import-export-manager.js** (lines 71-197)
- Updated merge logic to work with `today[]` and `tomorrow[]` arrays
- Handles both file import and clipboard import
- Still relies on `Storage.migrateData()` for format conversion

**scripts/dev-mode.js** (lines 152-153)
- Test task generation updated for v3 format

### 🔴 Incomplete and Broken

**scripts/sync.js** - **ROOT CAUSE OF FAILURES**

**Problem 1: compress/decompress (lines 25-158)**
- `compress()` (line 56-91): Still builds v2 format `{tasks: []}` for export
- `decompress()` (line 115-158): Expects v2 format `{tasks: []}`
- **Result**: Export works, but round-trip (export→import→export) breaks
- **Fix needed**: Update to export/import `{today: [], tomorrow: []}` directly

**Problem 2: generateQRData (lines 165-254)**
- Updated for v3 BUT has bugs in parent/subtask handling
- Lines 169-179: Filters parents and subtasks separately, then recombines
- **Issue**: When a parent appears in BOTH lists, it gets confusing indices
- **Result**: QR generation may include parent twice with wrong indices
- **Fix needed**: Build unified task list maintaining correct parent references

**Problem 3: parseQRData (lines 262-370)**
- Returns v2 format (`{tasks: [], version: 2}`)
- This is OKAY because `Storage.migrateData()` handles v2→v3
- BUT: If `generateQRData()` has bugs, parsed data will be wrong
- **Fix needed**: Debug hand-in-hand with generateQRData()

## Exact Bugs to Fix

### Bug 1: sync.js compress() - Lines 56-91

**Current behavior**: Exports v2 format
```javascript
return {
  tasks: [...],  // Array with list property
  version: 2
};
```

**Needed behavior**: Export v3 format
```javascript
return {
  today: [...],     // Tasks in Today list
  tomorrow: [...],  // Tasks in Tomorrow list
  version: 3
};
```

**How to fix**:
```javascript
compress(data) {
  // ...compression logic...
  return {
    today: data.today || [],
    tomorrow: data.tomorrow || [],
    totalCompleted: data.totalCompleted || 0,
    version: 3,
    currentDate: data.currentDate,
    lastUpdated: data.lastUpdated
  };
}
```

### Bug 2: sync.js decompress() - Lines 115-158

**Current behavior**: Expects v2 format
```javascript
const tasks = [];
// ...builds tasks array...
return { tasks, version: 2 };
```

**Needed behavior**: Parse v3 format OR let migration handle it
```javascript
decompress(text) {
  // ...decompression logic...
  const data = JSON.parse(decompressed);

  // If old format, migration will handle it
  // If new format, return as-is
  return data;
}
```

### Bug 3: sync.js generateQRData() - Lines 169-240

**Current behavior**: Separates parents/subtasks, causing index confusion
```javascript
const todayIncompleteTasks = (data.today || []).filter(task => !task.completed && !task.parentId);
const tomorrowIncompleteTasks = (data.tomorrow || []).filter(task => !task.completed && !task.parentId);
const allIncompleteTasks = [...todayIncompleteTasks, ...tomorrowIncompleteTasks];

const todaySubtasks = (data.today || []).filter(task => !task.completed && task.parentId);
const tomorrowSubtasks = (data.tomorrow || []).filter(task => !task.completed && task.parentId);
const allSubtasks = [...todaySubtasks, ...tomorrowSubtasks];

const incompleteTasks = [...allIncompleteTasks, ...allSubtasks];
```

**Problem**: If parent appears in BOTH today and tomorrow, it gets added twice!

**Needed behavior**: Build single deduplicated list
```javascript
// Get ALL unique incomplete tasks (including parents and subtasks)
const seenIds = new Set();
const incompleteTasks = [];

[...data.today, ...data.tomorrow].forEach(task => {
  if (!task.completed && !seenIds.has(task.id)) {
    seenIds.add(task.id);
    incompleteTasks.push(task);
  }
});
```

Then use existing `getTaskList()` helper to determine which list each task is in.

## Testing Strategy

### Before Fixing Anything

```bash
npm run test:e2e
# Expected: 60/75 passing (80.0%)
# Failing: 6 import-export, 4 QR, 5 subtask tests
```

### After Fixing sync.js compress/decompress

```bash
npm run test:e2e
# Expected: 66/75 passing (88.0%)
# Fixed: 6 import-export tests
# Still failing: 4 QR, 5 subtask tests
```

### After Fixing generateQRData/parseQRData

```bash
npm run test:e2e
# Expected: 70/75 passing (93.3%)
# Fixed: 6 import-export, 4 QR tests
# Still failing: 5 subtask tests
```

### After Debugging Subtask Tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e
# Expected: 75/75 passing (100.0%) 🎉
```

**Note**: Subtask failures are likely test timing issues, NOT app bugs. The architecture is sound, rendering might just need a small delay.

---

## What NOT to Do

### ❌ DO NOT Revert the Refactor

**Wrong approach**: "This is too broken, let's go back to v2 format"

**Why wrong**: The refactor is 80% done and the architecture is BETTER. Reverting wastes all progress and leaves the original bugs unfixed.

**Right approach**: Fix the remaining 20% (serialization bugs in sync.js)

### ❌ DO NOT Add `task.list` Property Back

**Wrong approach**: "Some code expects task.list, let's add it back"

**Why wrong**: That defeats the entire purpose of the refactor. The v3 format is LIST-contains-TASKS, not TASK-knows-LIST.

**Right approach**: Use `getTaskList(id)` helper wherever you need to know which list a task is in

### ❌ DO NOT Try to Support v2 and v3 Simultaneously

**Wrong approach**: "Let's make sync.js handle both formats"

**Why wrong**: Migration already handles backward compatibility. Export should ONLY produce v3.

**Right approach**: Export v3 only. Migration handles old data on import.

### ❌ DO NOT Modify getRenderData() Logic

**Wrong approach**: "Parents appearing in both lists seems like a bug, let me fix that"

**Why wrong**: That's the CORRECT behavior! It's how the v3 format solves the original bugs.

**Right approach**: Trust the architecture. Only fix serialization.

## Commit Strategy

### Commit 1: Fix sync.js compress/decompress
```bash
git add scripts/sync.js
git commit -m "Fix sync compress/decompress for v3 list arrays

- Update compress() to export {today: [], tomorrow: []} format
- Update decompress() to parse v3 format
- Fixes 6 import-export tests
- Part of v3 data structure refactor"
```

### Commit 2: Fix sync.js QR generation
```bash
git add scripts/sync.js
git commit -m "Fix QR generation for v3 list arrays with deduplication

- Fix generateQRData() to deduplicate parents appearing in both lists
- Use seenIds Set to prevent duplicate parent entries
- Maintain correct parent reference indices
- Fixes 4 QR sync tests
- Part of v3 data structure refactor"
```

### Commit 3: Complete v3 refactor (when all tests pass)
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Complete v3 data structure refactor - lists contain tasks

BREAKING CHANGE: Data format changed from v2 to v3
- v2: Single tasks[] array with list property on each task
- v3: Separate today[] and tomorrow[] arrays (no list property)

Benefits:
- Eliminates duplicate parent bugs (#2, #3, #4 from BUGS_FOUND.md)
- Simplifies rendering logic (parents appear where children are)
- More intuitive data model (lists contain tasks, not vice versa)
- Fixes parent auto-completion across lists (bug #1)

Migration:
- Automatic v2→v3 migration on load (storage.js migrateData)
- Parents automatically added to both lists if they have children in both
- No user action required

Test results: 75/75 passing (100.0%)

Closes #1, #2, #3, #4 from BUGS_FOUND.md"

## Emergency Revert Instructions

**If you MUST revert** (only if absolutely necessary):

```bash
# Find the commit before this session started
git log --oneline | head -20

# Revert to last good commit (should be a685abd or similar)
git reset --hard a685abd

# Force push (CAUTION)
git push origin main --force
```

**Before reverting**, please:
1. Read this status file completely
2. Understand the refactor is 80% done
3. Try fixing the remaining 20% first
4. Only revert as absolute last resort

The work done is valuable and the architecture is correct. Reverting wastes progress.

## Core Principle to Remember

> "Lists contain tasks. Tasks don't know which list they're in. The list arrays ARE the source of truth."

This is the foundation of v3. Trust it. Fix serialization, don't question the architecture.
