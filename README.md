# Do It (Later)

A maintenance-free PWA todo app with just two lists: **Today** and **Later**.

## 🎯 Philosophy

Ultra-simple task management that gets out of your way. Add tasks, complete them, or push them to later. That's it.

## ✨ Features

### 📅 Deadlines Feature

Tasks can have deadlines that automatically manage themselves:
- **Set via Long Press:** Hold task → Set Deadline
- **Auto-Important:** Tasks become important 3 days before deadline
- **Auto-Move:** Tasks move to Today list on deadline day
- **Visual Indicators:** Color-coded badges show deadline status
  - Red: Overdue
  - Orange: Due today
