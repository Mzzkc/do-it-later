## TDF Alignment:
All agents using Tetrahedral Decision Framework:
- COMP: Logic, dependencies, v3 invariant structure
- SCI: Test evidence, git history, actual failures
- CULT: Who created, why exists, original intent
- EXP: Workaround vs real solution, confidence
- Recognition: ≥P² understanding before fixes
