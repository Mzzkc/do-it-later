### [ ] Phase 2: Core Task Engine  
**Phase_TaskEngine_20250923_142800**
- **Duration:** 4-5 days
- **Dependencies:** Phase 1 (PWA Foundation)
- **Complexity:** High
- **Success Criteria:** Full task management without sync

**Deliverables:**
- Two-list data model (Today/Tomorrow)
- localStorage persistence layer
- Three core actions: Add, Complete, Push to Tomorrow
- Daily rollover logic
- Date display and tracking
- Basic task rendering

**Validation Gate:** All three actions work, data persists, daily rollover functions correctly

---

### [ ] Phase 3: User Experience Polish
**Phase_UXPolish_20250923_142900**
- **Duration:** 3-4 days  
- **Dependencies:** Phase 2 (Core Task Engine)
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Success Criteria:** Production-ready user interface

**Deliverables:**
- Mobile-optimized touch interactions
- Keyboard shortcuts for desktop
- Visual feedback and micro-interactions
- Aesthetic design implementation
- Ephemeral storage notice
- Error handling and edge cases
- Performance optimizations

**Validation Gate:** <10 second new user onboarding, <2 second load times, intuitive without explanation

---

### [ ] Phase 4: Discord Integration (Optional)
**Phase_DiscordSync_20250923_143000**
- **Duration:** 5-6 days
- **Dependencies:** Phase 3 (UX Polish)  
- **Complexity:** High
- **Success Criteria:** Cross-device sync via Discord messages

**Deliverables:**
- Discord OAuth authentication flow
- Private channel/server setup guide
- Message format specification (task actions)
- Sync state reconstruction logic
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Setup wizard for Discord integration
- Graceful degradation when offline

**Validation Gate:** Tasks sync across devices, Discord integration is optional, setup process is clear

---

### [ ] Phase 5: Testing & Deployment
**Phase_TestingDeployment_20250923_143100**
- **Duration:** 2-3 days
- **Dependencies:** Phase 4 (Discord Integration) OR Phase 3 (if skipping Discord)
- **Complexity:** Low
- **Success Criteria:** Production-ready deployment

**Deliverables:**
- Cross-platform testing (iOS, Android, Desktop browsers)
- Performance validation and optimization
- Security review (especially Discord OAuth)
- Deployment configuration
- Basic analytics setup (optional)
- Documentation for users

**Validation Gate:** Zero critical bugs, meets all success criteria, ready for public use

## Dependencies & Critical Path

```
Phase 1 (PWA Foundation)
    ↓
Phase 2 (Core Task Engine) 
    ↓
Phase 3 (UX Polish)
    ↓
Phase 4 (Discord Integration) [OPTIONAL]
    ↓
Phase 5 (Testing & Deployment)
```

**Critical Path:** Phases 1-3 are essential for MVP  
**Optional Path:** Phase 4 can be skipped for faster delivery  
**Parallel Work:** Some Phase 3 elements can begin during Phase 2 completion

---

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### [ ] Technical Risks

**RISK: Discord API Complexity** - Medium Impact, Low Probability
- Mitigation: Make Phase 4 truly optional, design core app to work standalone
- Contingency: Skip Discord integration for initial release

**RISK: Cross-Platform Compatibility Issues** - Medium Impact, Medium Probability  
- Mitigation: Test early and often, progressive enhancement approach
- Contingency: Focus on primary platforms (iOS Safari, Chrome) first

**RISK: PWA Installation Issues** - Low Impact, Medium Probability
- Mitigation: Provide fallback instructions, ensure web app works without installation
- Contingency: Web-only deployment if PWA features fail

### [ ] Scope Risks

**RISK: Feature Creep** - High Impact, Medium Probability
- Mitigation: Strict adherence to requirements doc, "simplicity first" principle
- Contingency: Remove features rather than extend timeline

**RISK: Discord Setup Complexity** - Medium Impact, High Probability
- Mitigation: Comprehensive setup guide, make integration truly optional
- Contingency: Remove Discord integration if user testing shows confusion

## Quality Gates

### [ ] Phase Completion Criteria

Each phase requires:
- [ ] All deliverables completed and tested
- [ ] Validation gate criteria met
- [ ] Code review and basic security check
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] User testing (for UX-critical phases)

### [ ] Overall Success Metrics

**Technical Benchmarks:**

- Works offline after initial load
- Zero crashes during core workflows
- Passes accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**User Experience Benchmarks:**
- New user completes first task in <10 seconds
- Interface requires no explanation
- Core actions work with single touch/click
- Cross-device sync (if enabled) works seamlessly

## Timeline & Milestones

**Week 1:**
- Days 1-3: Phase 1 (PWA Foundation)
- Days 4-7: Phase 2 (Core Task Engine) - Start

**Week 2:** 
- Days 1-2: Phase 2 (Core Task Engine) - Complete
- Days 3-5: Phase 3 (UX Polish)

**Week 3:**
- Days 1-5: Phase 4 (Discord Integration)

**Week 4:**
- Days 1-2: Phase 5 (Testing & Deployment)
- Days 3-5: Buffer for fixes and polish

**Decision Point:** End of Week 2 - Assess if Discord integration is needed for launch
