# Phase 2 Core Task Engine - Validation Checklist

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Data Model Implementation
- [x] Two-list structure (Today/Tomorrow arrays)
- [x] Task object structure with id, text, completed, createdAt
- [x] localStorage persistence via Storage utility
- [x] Current date tracking for rollover logic

### 2. Core CRUD Operations
- [x] `addTask(text, list='tomorrow')` - Adds to Tomorrow by default
- [x] `completeTask(id)` - Toggles completion status
- [x] `pushToTomorrow(id)` - Moves task from Today to Tomorrow
- [x] `findTask(id)` - Helper to locate tasks across lists
- [x] `deleteTask(id)` - Optional cleanup function

### 3. Daily Rollover Logic
- [x] `checkDateRollover()` - Moves Tomorrow ‚Üí Today on new day
- [x] Date comparison using ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- [x] Automatic execution on app initialization

### 4. Task Rendering System
- [x] `render()` - Main rendering coordinator
- [x] `renderList(listName, tasks)` - Renders individual lists
- [x] `getTaskHTML(task, listName)` - Generates task HTML
- [x] XSS protection via `escapeHtml()`
- [x] Empty state messages for each list

### 5. User Interface
- [x] Input field for new tasks with placeholder
- [x] Add button and Enter key support
- [x] Task action buttons (complete ‚úì, push ‚è≠)
- [x] Visual feedback (completed tasks, hover states)
- [x] Mobile-friendly touch targets (44px minimum)

### 6. Event Handling
- [x] Button click events for add task
- [x] Enter key support in input field
- [x] Global app instance for onclick handlers
- [x] Auto-focus input field for quick entry

### 7. CSS Styling
- [x] Task item layout and styling
- [x] Action button styling (complete, undo, push)
- [x] Input field styling with focus states
- [x] Responsive add-task container
- [x] Visual states for completed tasks

## üéØ Core Functions Test Cases

To test the implementation, verify these behaviors:

1. **Adding Tasks**
   - New tasks appear in Tomorrow list
   - Input field clears after adding
   - Focus remains on input for quick additional entries

2. **Completing Tasks**
   - Click ‚úì to mark complete (strikethrough text)
   - Click ‚Ü∂ to undo completion
   - Tasks remain in their current list

3. **Push to Tomorrow**
   - ‚è≠ button only appears on Today tasks
   - Clicking moves task from Today to Tomorrow
   - Task maintains its completion status

4. **Daily Rollover**
   - Tomorrow tasks move to Today on new day
   - Tomorrow list becomes empty
   - Current date updates in header

5. **Persistence**
   - Data survives browser refresh
   - Tasks persist between sessions
   - localStorage warning displayed

## üîç Manual Testing Steps

1. Open http://localhost:8000 in browser
2. Check console for initialization messages
3. Verify demo tasks appear correctly
4. Add new task using input field
5. Mark tasks complete/incomplete
6. Push today tasks to tomorrow
7. Refresh browser to test persistence

## ‚ú® Phase 2 Success Criteria

- [x] All core functions implemented and working
- [x] Clean, readable code structure
- [x] Mobile-first responsive design
- [x] Proper error handling
- [x] localStorage persistence with demo data
- [x] Intuitive three-action UI (Add, Complete, Push)
